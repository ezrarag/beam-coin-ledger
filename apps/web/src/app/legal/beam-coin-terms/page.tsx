      <h1>BEAM Coin Terms of Use</h1>

      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 30, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        BEAM Coin ("BEAM") is a non-transferable digital credit issued by BEAM Organizations to reward participants for
        verified activities such as training, performance, community service, or project milestones.
        BEAM Coins represent a right to redeem U.S. dollar equivalents through approved payout channels.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Earning BEAM</h2>
      <p>
        Participants earn BEAM through eligible programs verified by a BEAM administrator or partner organization.
        Each activity defines its own reward rate and verification process.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Redemption Value</h2>
      <p>
        One (1) BEAM is anchored to one U.S. dollar (USD $1.00) when redeemed through the official BEAM Ledger platform.
        BEAM reserves the right to adjust this conversion policy if required by law or funding availability.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Transfer and Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        BEAM Coins are not cryptocurrency, securities, or legal tender. They cannot be sold, traded, or transferred outside
        the BEAM Ledger platform except as authorized by BEAM.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Payout Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Redemptions are handled via Stripe Connect and require the participant to complete Know-Your-Customer (KYC)
        onboarding and provide a valid U.S. bank account or debit card.
        Standard processing time is 1â€“3 business days.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        BEAM redemptions may constitute taxable income. BEAM and its affiliates may issue IRS Form 1099-NEC for
        redemptions exceeding the reporting threshold. Recipients are responsible for all applicable taxes.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Suspension and Fraud</h2>
      <p>
        BEAM may suspend balances or cancel transactions suspected of fraudulent activity or policy violations.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Liability and Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        BEAM Coin balances do not earn interest and are subject to funding availability within BEAM's designated reserve
        accounts. BEAM is not liable for delays caused by bank partners or payment processors.
      </p>
